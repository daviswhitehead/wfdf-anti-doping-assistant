**Use of medications and TUEs**

Please find [WFDF's Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) Process at this link](https://wfdf.sport/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WFDF-Tue-Process-v2025-09.pdf).

Extract:

**WHAT IS A THERAPEUTIC USE EXEMPTION (TUE)?**

Athletes may have illnesses or conditions that require them to take medications or undergo procedures. If the medication or method an athlete is required to use to treat an illness or condition is prohibited as per the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) Prohibited List a TUE may give that athlete the authorization to use that substance or method while competing without invoking an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) and applicable sanction. Applications for TUEs are evaluated by a panel of physicians, the TUE Committee (TUEC).

**WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR GRANTING A TUE?**

All of the four following criteria must be met (for more details, please refer to the WADA International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions (ISTUE) Article 4.2):

- The athlete has a clear diagnosed medical condition which requires treatment using a prohibited substance or method;
- The therapeutic use of the substance will not, on the balance of probabilities produce significant enhancement of performance beyond the athlete’s normal state of health;
- The prohibited substance or method is an indicated treatment for the medical condition, and there is no reasonable permitted therapeutic alternative;-§ The necessity to use that substance or method is not a consequence of the prior use (without a TUE), of a substance or method which was prohibited at the time of use.

**WHO SHOULD APPLY FOR A TUE? WHERE AND WHEN TO APPLY?**

Athletes who are subject to anti-doping rules would need a TUE to take a prohibited substance or use a prohibited method. You should verify with WFDF to know to whom you need to apply and if you can apply retroactively. First, check if the required medication or method you intend to take, or use is prohibited as per the [WADA Prohibited List](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list).

You may also use a ‘check your medication’ online too or ask your NADO if it has one.

You have a responsibility to inform your physician(s) that you are an Athlete bound to anti-doping rules. You and your physician(s) should check the Prohibited List for the substance/method you are prescribed. If the substance/method is prohibited, discuss non-prohibited alternatives, if there are none, apply for a TUE. Remember Athletes have the ultimate responsibility. Contact your NADO or WFDF if you are having difficulties. Then, contact WFDF under antidoping@wfdf.sport to determine your competition level and TUE application requirements.

If it is determined that you are an International-Level Athlete what means that you are competing in WFDF international events on the official WFDF calendar of events you must apply to WFDF in advance, as soon as the need arises, unless there are emergency or exceptional circumstances.

For substances prohibited in-competition only, you should apply for a TUE at least 30 days before your next competition, unless one of the exceptions on retroactive TUEs (see below) apply.

Please refer to the section “How to apply to WFDF for a TUE?” below.

If you already have a TUE granted by your National Anti-Doping Organization (NADO) WFDF applies an automatic recognition from all NADOs or for all substances on the prohibited list.

In such case, please notify WFDF that you have a TUE granted by your NADO.

If you are NOT an International-Level Athlete and you have been tested by WFDF, WFDF recognizes a valid TUE granted by your NADO (i.e., it satisfies the ISTUE criteria for granting a TUE); unless you are required to apply for recognition of the TUE because you are competing in an international event.

If you are NOT a National-Level Athlete as defined by your NADO and you have been tested by WFDF, you must apply for a retroactive TUE to WFDF.

**HOW TO APPLY TO WFDF FOR A TUE?**

Through ADAMS or paper format / electronic TUE form.

WFDF encourages to submit TUE applications via ADAMS, together with the required medical information. If you do not have an ADAMS account yet, please contact antidoping@wfdf.sport to have it set up.

Otherwise, please download the [WFDF’s TUE Application Form](https://wfdf.sport/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WFDF-TUE-Application-Form-v2025.docx), and once duly completed and signed, send it together with the required medical file to antidoping@wfdf.sport.

Your TUE application must be submitted in legible capital letters or typing.

The medical file must include:

- A comprehensive medical history, including documentation from the original diagnosing physician(s) (where possible);
- The results of all examinations, laboratory investigations and imaging studies relevant to the application.
- Regarding to the costs related to a TUE application those are the responsibility of the Athlete, including any required additional medical examinations, tests, imaging studies, etc.

Any TUE application that is not complete or legible will not be dealt with and will be returned for completion and re-submission.

To assist you and your doctor in providing the correct medical documentation, we suggest consulting the WADA’sChecklists for TUE applications for guidance and support, and TUE Physician Guidelines for guidance on specific common medical conditions, treatments, substances, etc.

Keep a complete copy of the TUE application form and all medical information submitted in support of your application, and proof that it has been sent.

**Testing procedures, including urine, blood and the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)**

**Introduction to Doping Control**

The aim of testing is to detect and deter doping amongst athletes and to protect clean athletes. Any athlete under the testing jurisdiction of WFDF may be tested at any time, with no advance notice, in- or out-of-competition, and be required to provide a urine or a blood sample.

Athletes can be tested by WFDF, their International Federation or Major Event Organisers. The WFDF their anti-doping programs to the International Testing Agency (ITA).

**What to expect during the Doping Control Process**

The doping control process is clearly defined by the [World Anti-Doping Agency](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/athletes-support-personnel/anti-doping-process). This means that no matter where and when an athlete is tested, the process should remain the same.

The key steps of the doping control process are listed out in this [Doping Control](https://ita.sport/resource/ita-real-sport-lab/) [resource](https://ita.sport/resource/ita-real-sport-lab/) prepared by the International Testing Agency (also available in Arabic (عربى), Chinese (中文), French (français), German (deutsche), Italian (italiano), Japanese (日本語), Korean (한국어), Portuguese (português), Russian (русский) and Spanish (español).

To learn more about the doping control process, please watch this [ITA webinar](https://youtu.be/qIQcQdL7q3Y) on urine and blood sample collection.

**Rights & Responsibilities during Sample Collection**

Athlete rights during sample collection are to:

- Have a representative accompany them during the process
- Request an interpreter, if one is available
- Ask for Chaperone’s/Doping Control Officer’s identification
- Ask any questions
- Request a delay for a valid reason (e.g., attending a victory ceremony, receiving necessary medical attention, warming down or finishing a training session)
- Request special assistance or modifications to the process
- Record any comments or concerns on the Doping Control Form

Athlete responsibilities during sample collection are to:

- Report for testing immediately if selected
- Show valid identification (usually a government-issued ID)
- Remain in direct sight of the Doping Control Officer or Chaperone
- Comply with the collection procedure

**Athlete Biological Passport**

The [Athlete Biological Passport](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/athlete-biological-passport) (ABP) was introduced in 2009 and is a pillar method in the detection of doping. It is an individual electronic profile that monitors selected athlete biological variables that indirectly reveal the effects of doping. ABP is integrated directly into ADAMS.

If you wish to learn more about ABP, you can watch this ITA [webinar recording](https://ita.sport/news/ita-webinar-the-athlete-biological-passport-a-practical-guide/)
