# Introduction - Principles and values associated with clean sport

Anti-doping programs are founded on the intrinsic value of sport. This intrinsic value is often referred to as "the spirit of sport": the ethical pursuit of human excellence through the dedicated perfection of each Athlete’s natural talents.

Anti-doping programs seek to protect the health of Athletes and to provide the opportunity for Athletes to pursue human excellence without the Use of Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods. Anti-doping programs seek to maintain the integrity of sport in terms of respect for rules, other competitors, fair competition, a level playing field, and the value of clean sport to the world.

The spirit of sport is the celebration of the human spirit, body and mind. It is the essence of Olympism and is reflected in the values we find in and through sport, including:

- Health
- Ethics, fair play and honesty
- Athletes’ rights as set forth in the Code
- Excellence in performance

# Athletes’, ASP’s and other groups’ rights and responsibilities under the Code

**Rights and Responsibilities**

- Athletes, Athlete Support Personnel and other groups who are subject to anti-doping rules all have rights and responsibilities under the [World Anti-Doping Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/the-code/world-anti-doping-code). Part Three of the Code outlines these for each stakeholder in the anti-doping system.
- It is especially important that athletes and Athlete Support Personnel know and understand [Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/the-code/world-anti-doping-code) 21 (Additional Roles and Responsibilities of Athletes and Other Persons), particularly Art. 21.1 (Roles and Responsibilities of Athletes), Art. 21.2 (Roles and Responsibilities of Athlete Support Personnel) and Art. 21.3 (Roles and Responsibilities of Other Persons Subject to the Code).
- Athletes’ Rights
- This section presents a summary of the key athlete rights. It is important that both athletes and Athlete Support Personnel know and understand these.
- Ensuring that athletes are aware of their rights and these are respected is vital to the success of clean sport. Athlete rights exist throughout the [Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/the-code/world-anti-doping-code) and International Standards and they include:Equality of opportunityEquitable and Fair Testing programsMedical treatment and protection of health rightsRight to justiceRight to accountabilityWhistle-blower rightsRight to educationRight to data protectionRights to compensationProtected Persons RightsRights during a Sample Collection SessionRight to B sample analysisOther rights and freedoms not affectedApplication and standing

The Athletes’ Anti-Doping Rights Act sets out these rights and responsibilities. For more information, you can refer directly to the document here: [Athletes’ Anti-Doping Rights Act](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/athletes-anti-doping-rights-act).

**Athletes’ Responsibilities**

- It is equally important that athletes are aware of their anti-doping responsibilities.Athlete Support Personnel should also familiarise themselves with these in order to be able to support their athletes. These include:Knowing and following WFDF Anti-Doping Rules and any other applicable Anti-Doping RulesTaking full responsibility for what you ingest – make sure that no prohibited substance enters your body and that no prohibited methods are usedInforming medical personnel of your obligations as an athleteCooperating with WFDF and other ADOs (WADA, ITA)Being available for sample collectionNot working with coaches, trainers, physicians or other Athlete Support Personnel who are ineligible on account of an ADRV, or those who have been criminally convicted or disciplined in relation to doping (see [WADA’s Prohibited Association List](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list))Further details of these roles and responsibilities can be found in [Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/the-code/world-anti-doping-code) Art. 21.1.Athletes also have specific rights and responsibilities during the Doping Control Process. Please refer to this section here for more information on this.

**Rights and Responsibilities of Athlete Support Personnel and other groups**

- Like athletes, Athlete Support Personnel and others under the jurisdiction of WFDF also have rights and responsibilities as per the [Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/the-code/world-anti-doping-code). These include:Being knowledgeable of anti-doping policies and rules which are applicable to you and to the athlete(s) you supportUsing your influence on athlete values and behaviours to foster anti-doping attitudesComplying with all anti-doping policies and rules which are applicable to you and the athlete(s) you supportCooperating with the athlete testing programDisclosing to the WFDF whether you have committed any Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRVs) within the previous ten yearsCooperating with ADOs investigating ADRVsFurther details of these roles and responsibilities can be found in [Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/the-code/world-anti-doping-code) Art. 21.2 and 21.3.

**The principle of strict liability**The principle of strict liability is applied in situations where urine/blood samples collected from an athlete have produced adverse analytical results.

It means that each athlete is strictly liable for the substances found in his or her bodily specimen, and that an anti-doping rule violation occurs whenever a prohibited substance (or its metabolites or markers) is found in bodily specimen, whether or not the athlete intentionally or unintentionally used a prohibited substance or was negligent or otherwise at fault.

**Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRVs)**

Doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRVs):

- presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers in an athlete’s sample;
- use or attempted use by an athlete of a prohibited substance or method;
- evading, refusing, or failing to submit to sample collection by an athlete;
- whereabouts failures by an athlete;
- tampering or attempted tampering with any part of doping control by an athlete or other person;
- possession of a prohibited substance or method by an athlete or athlete support person;
- trafficking or attempted trafficking in any prohibited substance or method by an athlete or other person;
- administration or attempted administration by an athlete or other person to any athlete in-competition of any prohibited substance or method; out-of-competition if the substance or method is prohibited out-of-competition;
- complicity or attempted complicity by an athlete or other person;
- prohibited association by an athlete or other person;
- actions by an athlete or other person to discourage or retaliate against reporting to authorities, to frighten someone from reporting suspected doping or to revenge against those who have reported.

**Risks of supplement use**

Extreme caution is recommended regarding supplement use. A number of positive tests have been attributed to the misuse of supplements, poor labelling or contamination of dietary supplements. There is no guarantee that any supplement is free from prohibited substances.

Risks of supplements include:

- Manufacturing standards, which are often less strict compared with medicines. These lower standards often lead to supplement contamination with an undeclared prohibited substance;
- Fake or low-quality products which may contain prohibited substances – and be harmful to health;
- Mislabelling of supplements with ingredients wrongly listed and prohibited substances not identified on the product label;
- False claims that a particular supplement is endorsed by ADOs or that it is “safe for athletes”. Remember, ADOs do not certify supplements and product labels may contain misleading messaging.

All athletes should do a risk-benefit assessment if they are considering the use of supplements. The first step of such an assessment is to consider whether a “food-first” approach meets the athlete’s needs. Whenever possible, such an assessment should be done with the support of a certified nutritionist or other qualified professional who is familiar with the anti-doping rules.

**Checking Supplements**

If, after careful consideration, an athlete chooses to use supplements, they must take the necessary steps to minimise the risks. This includes:

- Thorough research on the type and dose of the supplement, preferably with the advice of a certified nutritionist or other qualified professional who is familiar with the global and any sport-specific anti-doping rules.
- Selecting only those supplements that have been batch-tested by an independent company. Companies that batch-test supplements include [Informed Sport](https://sport.wetestyoutrust.com/), [Certified for Sport](https://www.nsfsport.com/) or [Kölner Liste](https://www.koelnerliste.com/en/).

Remember, no supplement is 100% risk-free but athletes and Athlete Support Personnel can take certain steps to minimise these risks.
