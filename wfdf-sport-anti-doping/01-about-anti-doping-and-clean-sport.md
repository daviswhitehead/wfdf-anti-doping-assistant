Doping can be harmful to an athlete’s health, damages the integrity of sport, and is morally and ethically wrong. All athletes participating in WFDF competitions must abide by the WFDF Anti-Doping Rules.

**What is doping?**

Doping is not just a positive test showing the presence of a prohibited substance in an athlete’s urine sample. Doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the 11 Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRVs) outlined in the [World Anti-Doping Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/the-code/world-anti-doping-code) and WFDF Anti-Doping Rules. These are:

1. **Presence** of a prohibited substance, its metabolites or markers in an athlete’s sample
2. **Use or attempted use** of a prohibited substance or method by an athlete
3. **Refusing**, evading or failing to submit to sample collection by an athlete
4. **Failure to file** whereabouts information and/or missed tests by an athlete
5. **Tampering** or attempted tampering with the doping control process by an athlete or other person
6. **Possession** of a prohibited substance or method by an athlete or athlete support personnel
7. **Trafficking** or attempted trafficking of a prohibited substance or method by an athlete or other person
8. **Administering** or attempting to administer a prohibited substance or method to an athlete
9. **Complicity** or attempted complicity in an ADRV by an athlete or other person
10. **Prohibited Association** by an athlete or other person with a sanctioned athlete support personnel
11. **Acts** to discourage or retaliate against reporting to authorities

**Why is doping in sport prohibited?**

The use of [doping substances or doping methods](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list#search-anchor) to enhance performance is fundamentally wrong and is detrimental to the overall spirit of sport. Drug misuse can be harmful to an athlete's health and to other athletes competing in the sport. It severely damages the integrity, image, and value of sport, whether or not the motivation to use drugs is to improve performance. To achieve integrity and fairness in sport, a commitment to clean sport is critical.
