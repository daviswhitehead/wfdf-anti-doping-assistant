# Creating a WFDIF anti-doping assistant (2025-09-29 18:49Z)

_**User (2025-09-29 18:49Z)**_

I'd like to create a custom GPT called WFDIF anti-doping assistant. The description of this GPT is that it should answer your questions on WFDIF's anti-doping policies. What I'm hoping this GPT can do is take all of the resources that we've compiled here in Markdown and PDF files and provide users with a chat-like experience where they can ask specific questions and get their answers. For example, I'd like to be able to chat with these resources and ask, "Hey, is creatine on the prohibited list? To make sure that I can keep taking creatine in advance of competing in this WFDIF competition." I'd like for all of my teammates to also be able to use this. Additionally, myself and my teammates are required to pass a educational course in these materials and policies, and I'd like for this GPT to be a resource in helping answer any of the tough questions as part of that course. Can you tell me what you think of this description in terms of the idea for a custom GPT and what you'd recommend to go ahead and start creating this?

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning custom GPT response**

I need to address a plan without code changes for creating a custom GPT. The user prefers reviewing exact code changes, but that’s not relevant right now. I can propose architecture options like OpenAI GPTs through the GPTs Builder or creating a RAG app with access control. It’ll be helpful to provide a detailed plan, including tools, hosting, privacy considerations, and a reminder that creatine isn’t prohibited per the WADA 2025 list, though I’ll verify that later.
**Clarifying planning steps**

I should focus on creating a plan for multi-step tasks and not generate a todo list until it’s necessary to implement. The user has asked for recommendations to begin creating, so I’ll provide a structured plan without implementing steps just yet. It seems the status updates are required when tool calls occur, but since I won’t be calling any tools right now, I can skip that part. I'll aim to keep everything concise and clear.
**Outlining planning steps**

I need to provide a clear plan that outlines key steps for the user. First, decide between using OpenAI GPTs or a self-hosted RAG. Then, for data ingestion, convert PDFs to text and manage metadata. For retrieval, I’ll suggest embedding models and vector databases. During the chat phase, it’s good to use GPT-4.1 while ensuring to cite sources. Also, I must include compliance notes and evaluation strategies, while keeping privacy considerations in check. I can suggest a minimal MVP path by starting with OpenAI Custom GPT.
**Clarifying sharing and next steps**

I need to mention that sharing would be limited to organization-only due to file caps and update constraints. After that, I can propose the next advanced step: building a RAG app. While I could offer to implement it right now by creating a Next.js app skeleton and an ingestion script, the user specifically asked for recommendations. So, I’ll conclude by inviting them to share their preference on how to proceed, keeping everything concise as requested.</details></think>

### Quick take
- **Great idea**: A focused “WFDIF Anti-Doping Assistant” is a perfect fit for a chat RAG assistant over your PDFs/Markdown, especially for prep and course support.
- **Two build paths**:
  - **Fastest**: OpenAI Custom GPT with uploaded knowledge files and tight instructions.
  - **Robust/team-ready**: A small RAG web app (Next.js) with embeddings + vector DB, citations, access control, and easy updates.

### Recommended approach
- **Phase 1 (MVP in hours) — Custom GPT**
  - Upload your `wfdf-sport-anti-doping/` Markdown and `world-anti-doping-agency/` PDFs.
  - Instructions (system prompt) focus:
    - Answer strictly from WFDF/WADA sources; cite doc + page/section.
    - If unknown or conflicting, say you’re unsure and point to the exact policy section to check.
    - Include course-support mode: break down tricky questions, show how to locate answers.
    - Add compliance note: “This is informational, not legal/medical advice. Policies change—always verify with the latest WFDF/WADA documents.”
  - Sharing: use your org workspace; share link with teammates; keep “keep chats” off if privacy-sensitive.
  - Limitations to note: file count/size caps, no fine-grained control over chunking, slower bulk updates.

- **Phase 2 (Team-grade) — RAG app**
  - **Ingestion**: convert PDFs to text, split into 800–1200 token chunks with overlap, store metadata (doc, section, page, effective date).
  - **Embeddings & Store**: `text-embedding-3-large` (quality) or `-small` (cost) + pgvector (Supabase/Postgres), or Weaviate/Chroma.
  - **Retriever**: hybrid (dense + keyword) with reranking; always return top-k with scores and metadata.
  - **Answering**: GPT-4.1 (or GPT-4o mini for cost) with strict instructions to quote and cite chunks; refuse outside-scope claims.
  - **UI**: Next.js chat with source cards (doc title, section, page, link), “View in doc” deep links, toggle “study mode” with step-by-step guidance.
  - **Access/Sharing**: org SSO, per-user logging with privacy controls; export Q&A for study.
  - **Ops**: a `docs/` folder watcher; ingestion script to add/update/delete; version pinning per list year; nightly re-embed if files change.
  - **Evaluation**: build a small QA set from your course; run offline evals (accuracy, groundedness, citation correctness); add guardrails (e.g., refuse medical dosing advice).

### Concrete next steps
- **If you want speed (Custom GPT now)**:
  1. Create a new GPT → “WFDIF Anti-Doping Assistant.”
  2. Upload your Markdown/PDFs as knowledge.
  3. Paste a tight instruction set (I can draft it).
  4. Test with queries like “Is creatine prohibited?” and verify the cited sections.
  5. Share with teammates via org link.

- **If you want durability (RAG app)**:
  1. Repo scaffold (Next.js + API routes + Supabase pgvector).
  2. Ingestion script: PDF-to-text + MD loader → chunk → embed → upsert.
  3. Chat endpoint with retrieval + rerank + GPT answer + citations.
  4. Simple UI with chat and source cards; deploy to Vercel; DB on Supabase.
  5. Add an eval set from your course; iterate on retrieval settings.

### Example of how it should answer
- **Question**: “Is creatine on the prohibited list?”
- **Expected behavior**: “Creatine is not on the WADA Prohibited List and is generally permitted. Always verify the current year’s List and any event-specific rules. See ‘2025 Prohibited List’, general notes/FAQs; no listing under S0–S9 or M1–M3.” With a citation to the exact document section/page.

### What I need from you
- Do you want the quick Custom GPT first, or should I set up the RAG app for your team?
- If Custom GPT: I’ll draft the instruction prompt and a minimal evaluation checklist.
- If RAG: I’ll scaffold the app and ingestion pipeline and wire it to your `wfdf-anti-doping-assistant` folder.

If you share your preference, I can start building immediately.

_**User (2025-09-29 18:49Z)**_

Let's go ahead and get started with the MVP custom GPT approach. Can you walk me through the next steps of that approach?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Guiding MVP Creation Steps**

I need to outline the steps for creating a custom GPT without requiring any code changes. The tool framework expects a todo list for multi-step tasks. I’ll draft a concise list, including the system prompt and evaluation checklist, while suggesting how to upload files and share settings. It’s also essential to provide test questions. If I create todos, I'll call the todo_write function, ensuring to include clear status updates on tool calls.
**Updating Tool Call Procedures**

I need to focus on updating the status before any tool calls. I'll create a todo list starting with "in_progress" as the first item. No additional tools are needed at this stage. Next, I should provide a clear instruction set, including a copy-pastable "Instructions" prompt, "Conversation starters," and guidance for uploading "Knowledge." It might be helpful to suggest organizing files, possibly with a zip format. Let's move ahead with these steps!</details></think>

---

I'll set up a lightweight plan so we can move quickly. I’m creating a short todo list and marking the first step in progress.

---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Create the Custom GPT shell (name, icon, description)
- [ ] Upload and organize knowledge files (Markdown/PDFs)
- [ ] Paste and finalize the system instructions
- [ ] Configure capabilities, privacy, and sharing for teammates
- [ ] Add conversation starters and testing/eval prompts
- [ ] Run smoke tests (creatine, caffeine, TUE, ADAMS whereabouts)
- [ ] Share with team and collect feedback

---

- I created a concise checklist and started the first task: create the Custom GPT shell.

### Step-by-step (takes ~10–15 minutes)

1) Create the GPT shell
- Go to the GPT builder in your OpenAI workspace → Create. Name it “WFDIF Anti‑Doping Assistant.”
- Set a simple icon (e.g., shield or whistle). Short description:
  - “Answers questions about WFDIF and WADA anti‑doping policies with citations.”

2) Upload your knowledge files
- Drag-drop the `wfdf-sport-anti-doping/` Markdown folder and `world-anti-doping-agency/` PDFs.
- Keep file names as-is; they’ll be used for citations.
- If a file is too large, split it logically (e.g., per chapter/section).

3) Paste the system instructions
- Copy this into the “Instructions” box. We’ll refine after smoke tests.

```text
You are the WFDIF Anti‑Doping Assistant.

Core behavior:
- Answer strictly and directly from uploaded WFDF/WADA sources.
- Always include citations with document name and page/section (e.g., “2025 Prohibited List, p. 7; WFDF Anti‑Doping Rules (2021), §10.3”).
- If the answer is unclear or policy-conflicting, say “I’m not fully certain” and point to the exact section(s) to verify. Offer to pull the relevant passages.
- Provide concise, plain‑language answers first, then a brief “Why/Where” citing the rule sections.
- When asked about substances, always check both substances (S0–S9) and methods (M1–M3), and note in‑competition vs out‑of‑competition differences, thresholds, and TUE exceptions where relevant.
- When asked about TUEs, explain eligibility, process steps, timelines, and required documents, then cite the ISTUE and WFDF TUE policy.
- When asked about whereabouts/ADAMS/testing, explain athlete responsibilities and cite applicable IS/Code sections.

Constraints and safety:
- This is educational information, not medical or legal advice.
- If a question seeks medical dosing guidance, refuse and redirect to a healthcare professional.
- Policies change. Prefer the latest year’s documents and state the effective date (e.g., 2025 List).
- If a doc isn’t present for a given year, say so and offer the latest available.

Answer format:
1) Short answer (1–3 sentences).
2) Citations with doc + page/section.
3) If helpful, add a short checklist or steps.

Examples:
Q: “Is creatine prohibited?”
A: “Creatine is not on the WADA Prohibited List; it is generally permitted. Verify the current year’s List before competition.”
Cite: “2025 Prohibited List (full list review: no creatine entry); WADA Athlete Guide to 2025 List, supplements section.”

Q: “Can I use inhaled salbutamol?”
A: “Permitted by inhalation up to X mcg per 24 hours with a maximum Y per 12 hours; urinary threshold Z ng/mL applies; excess use or IV administration may be prohibited. Check TUE needs if exceeding limits.”
Cite: “2025 Prohibited List, S3 Beta‑2 Agonists; ISTUE 2023.”
```

4) Configure capabilities, privacy, and sharing
- Disable browsing/tools unless you want web access; for MVP, keep it off to strictly ground in uploaded docs.
- Turn off training on user content; keep conversation retention per your org policy.
- Share with your org/team so everyone can access.

5) Add conversation starters
- “Is creatine prohibited?”
- “What substances are prohibited in‑competition vs out‑of‑competition?”
- “How do I apply for a TUE with WFDF?”
- “What are my Whereabouts obligations?”
- “What happens if I miss a test?”

6) Run smoke tests
- Ask 5–10 targeted questions. Verify it cites correct docs/sections and avoids guessing.
- Edge cases: caffeine thresholds, pseudoephedrine, beta‑2 agonists limits, IV infusions (>100 mL/12h), glucocorticoids washout, needle policies, Supplements/S0.

7) Share and collect feedback
- Post the link to teammates; ask for 3 sample questions each and any citation mismatches.

Would you like me to tailor the instructions with exact doc titles from your `world-anti-doping-agency/` and WFDF markdown files and produce a ready‑to‑paste prompt? If yes, I’ll scan the file names and assemble the citations language precisely.

---

_**User (2025-09-29 18:49Z)**_

Yes, please go ahead and tailor the instructions to the exact doc titles and create a ready-to-paste prompt. But go ahead and create a Markdown of that prompt here.

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating Markdown Prompt**

I need to create a Markdown prompt based on the document titles from our workspace. I can scan the file names because the directory listing is already available in project_layout. There's no need to use any tools here. However, the developer wants to keep track of updates for the todo list when tools are involved. Since we're just providing a prompt without code edits, I'll make sure to respect the user's preference to review diffs beforehand.
**Listing Document Names**

I need to include specific document names from the directories. For instance, in the wfdf-sport-anti-doping folder, we have titles like "01-about-anti-doping-and-clean-sport.md" and up to "11-sanctions-and-reports.md." Then, from the world-anti-doping-agency, there are important documents as well, such as "2021_wada_code.pdf" and the WADA 2025 Prohibited List. Additionally, I noticed "international_standard_isrm_-_abp_update_2023_final_0.pdf" likely pertains to Results Management. It's essential to be precise here!
**Crafting System Prompt**

I need to create a comprehensive system prompt that includes the role and the scope of sources. I plan to present human-readable titles for the files, which will make it easier to understand. For example, the filename "2025list_en_final_clean_12_september_2024.pdf" can be mapped to "The 2025 WADA Prohibited List (published Sept 12, 2024)." Other mappings include "Athlete and Athlete Support Personnel Guide to the 2025 List" and "World Anti-Doping Code 2021." It's essential to emphasize important documents, like the WFDF anti-doping rules.
**Creating Citation Instructions**

I need to emphasize that we should always cite document names along with pages or sections when possible. For PDFs, that means including page numbers, and for Markdown files, section headings work well. Since the GPT builder utilizes uploaded files, it’s helpful to instruct citing by filename and section header. I’ll write the prompt in Markdown format and provide a code block for easy copying. Moreover, I should update the todo list to mark "mvp-system-prompt" as in progress or pending.
**Reconciling Todo List**

Earlier, I had the task "mvp-gpt-shell" marked in progress; now as we're producing the prompt, I need to reconcile the todo list. We didn’t create the custom GPT shell because the user will do it in the UI, so I can't mark it as completed. Instead, I’ll keep it marked as pending. Now I need to update "Paste and finalize the system instructions" to in progress. I’ll go ahead with these updates and provide a status update line.</details></think>

---

I’m switching focus to drafting the tailored system instructions. I’m marking the instructions task in progress and putting the shell creation back to pending so you can do it in the UI.

---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [ ] Create the Custom GPT shell (name, icon, description)
- [ ] Upload and organize knowledge files (Markdown/PDFs)
- [-] Paste and finalize the system instructions
- [ ] Configure capabilities, privacy, and sharing for teammates
- [ ] Add conversation starters and testing/eval prompts
- [ ] Run smoke tests (creatine, caffeine, TUE, ADAMS whereabouts)
- [ ] Share with team and collect feedback

I set the “system instructions” task in progress and paused the shell creation until you finish the UI step.

### Ready-to-paste “Instructions” (Markdown)

```markdown
You are the WFDIF Anti‑Doping Assistant. You answer questions strictly from the uploaded WFDF and WADA materials. Provide concise, plain‑language answers with precise citations to the underlying documents (document title + page/section). If information is unclear, conflicting, or outside scope, say you’re not fully certain and point to the exact sections to verify.

Core behavior
- Ground answers only in the uploaded sources. Do not invent rules or rely on general knowledge.
- Always include citations:
  - For PDFs: “Document Title (exact filename if helpful), p. X” and section identifiers if present.
  - For Markdown: “Filename, [Section Heading]”.
- Prefer the most current/controlling source when content overlaps (e.g., 2025 Prohibited List for substance status).
- Highlight differences between in‑competition and out‑of‑competition, thresholds, classes (S0–S9; M1–M3), and any TUE exceptions where relevant.
- If a substance or scenario is not explicitly listed, state that it is not listed and direct the user to the closest applicable class/category and governing sections to review.
- If content appears contradictory across sources, say so, cite both, and recommend deferring to the controlling document (typically WADA List/Code/IS for global requirements and WFDF Rules for sport‑specific implementation).

Scope‑specific guidance
- Substances and Methods: Check the WADA Prohibited List 2025 first; confirm class, year applicability, thresholds, and in/out‑of‑competition status. Then cross‑reference WFDF summaries if needed.
- TUEs: Explain eligibility, documentation, timelines, and decision principles; cite ISTUE 2023 and WFDF’s TUE process markdown.
- Testing/Whereabouts/ADAMS: Use ISTI 2023 (and Annex K if applicable) and WFDF athlete duties markdown; clarify responsibilities and common violations.
- Results management and sanctions: Use ISRM 2023, Code 2021, ISCCS doc, and WFDF sanctions markdown.
- Education and privacy: Use ISE 2021 and ISPPPI 2021, plus WFDF data collection/privacy markdown.

Safety and disclaimers
- Provide educational information only. Not medical or legal advice.
- Policies can change. Prefer the latest documents and state effective years (e.g., “2025 Prohibited List”).
- If the needed document year is missing, state what year you’re using and suggest verifying the latest version.

Answer format
1) Short answer (1–3 sentences), plain language, directly addresses the question.
2) “Why/Where” with citations (document title + page/section).
3) If helpful, a brief checklist or steps to comply (bulleted).

Examples
- Q: “Is creatine prohibited?”
  - A: “Creatine is not listed as a prohibited substance on the WADA Prohibited List 2025; it is generally permitted. Verify the current year’s List before competition.”
  - Cite: “WADA Prohibited List 2025 (2025list_en_final_clean_12_september_2024.pdf): no entry under S0–S9; Athlete Guide to the 2025 List, supplements section.”

- Q: “Can I use inhaled salbutamol?”
  - A: “Inhaled salbutamol is permitted within specified dose limits and subject to a urinary threshold; exceeding limits or using other routes can be prohibited. Check whether your dosage requires a TUE.”
  - Cite: “WADA Prohibited List 2025, S3 Beta‑2 Agonists (2025list_en_final_clean_12_september_2024.pdf), p. [exact page]; ISTUE 2023 (international_standard_for_therapeutic_use_exemptions_istue_2023.pdf).”

- Q: “Are IV infusions allowed for recovery?”
  - A: “IV infusions/injections of >100 mL per 12 hours are prohibited except for legitimate hospital/clinical procedures or with a TUE.”
  - Cite: “WADA Prohibited List 2025, M2 (2025list_en_final_clean_12_september_2024.pdf), p. [exact page]; ISTI 2023 (isti_2023_w_annex_k_final_clean.pdf).”

- Q: “What happens if I miss a test?”
  - A: “A missed test or filing failure can count as a Whereabouts failure; three within 12 months may trigger an anti‑doping rule violation.”
  - Cite: “ISTI 2023 (isti_2023_w_annex_k_final_clean.pdf); WADA Code 2021 (2021_wada_code.pdf); WFDF ADRV overview (03-anti-doping-rule-violations-(adrv's).md).”

When uncertain
- If the precise threshold/limit/page is not immediately found, say “I’m not fully certain,” provide the best‑matching sections to check, and offer to quote the relevant passages.
- If a user asks about medical dosing or personalized medical advice, decline and refer to a healthcare professional, while still citing the relevant policy constraints.

Style
- Be concise, accurate, and neutral. Use the documents’ terminology (e.g., S‑classes, ISTI/ISTUE references).
- Keep answers scannable with short paragraphs or brief bullets.
```

- After you paste this:
  - Upload your WFDF `.md` files and the WADA PDFs exactly as listed so the file names match the citations.
  - During smoke tests, replace “[exact page]” placeholders with real page numbers you see in the UI to lock in confidence for common queries.

- Next I can draft conversation starters and a 10‑item smoke test set tailored to frequent questions (creatine, caffeine, pseudoephedrine, salbutamol, glucocorticoids in‑competition, IV infusions, needles, TUE timing, Whereabouts failures, results management timelines).

_**User (2025-09-29 18:49Z)**_

Ok I've taken your instructions and created @customGPT.md . Assume you're an expert in creating custom GPTs, sharing them with others, and scaling them. You have an excellent product mindset. How do these instructions look?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing instructions for improvements**

I want to review the instructions in customGPT.md and suggest some edits. The user prefers to see diffs before applying changes, so that’s a good approach. Although the user created the file, our job is to review and propose improvements.

I think we should update the status as the system instructions task is likely completed. Since our framework requires updates when tools are used, I’ll focus on providing feedback without any tool. For example, I suggest removing the "Search the web" line to avoid confusion. There's also a typo to fix: it should say WFDF instead of WFDIF.
**Suggesting improvements for documentation**

I’ve noticed we need to add a couple of miscellaneous PDFs: the WFDF TUE Process v2025-09 and a privacy notice, which should be part of the authoritative sources. These can be uploaded from the misc folder. Additionally, I’ll clarify that WFDF-specific documents should take precedence for WFDF processes, while WADA should be used for broader contexts. 

I also need to specify citation formats, require snippet quotes with section IDs, and remind that we don't give dosing advice. Plus, I’ll include a 'hallucination guard' to avoid answering questions not covered in our sources. Lastly, I’ll propose improvements to the Markdown format for better clarity.
**Creating Markdown and suggestions**

The user requested a revised Markdown block, and they have an existing file. I can provide a ready-to-paste version along with some conversation starters and evaluation sets later. 

I should keep everything concise as per their verbosity preference. It’s important to note any issues and propose both improvements and a bullet point list of what's good and what's to fix. 

I'd also want to include a minimal diff style since they prefer reviewing diffs. To adhere to their preferences, I’ll prepare a small bullet point list for suggested edits instead of applying changes directly.
**Providing Markdown and updates**

I need to show a patch using one of the methods available. I think providing a "replacement" Markdown block to paste will be sufficient. 

I also want to remind to add the two PDFs to the list. I'll keep the status update brief, followed by the improved prompt. 

Finally, I should include a summary at the end to wrap everything up nicely. Let’s get started on this!</details></think>

---

I reviewed your `customGPT.md`. It’s strong and close to production-ready. I’ll suggest a few targeted improvements, then provide a tightened, ready-to-paste replacement block.

- What’s good
  - Clear scope and strong grounding in WFDF/WADA sources
  - Concise answer format with citations
  - Solid examples and uncertainty handling

- Fixes to make
  - Typo: “WFDIF” → “WFDF” in the opening line.
  - Remove web search instruction (you said MVP should be grounded solely in uploaded docs).
  - Add WFDF PDFs you have in `misc/` to the sources list so the assistant cites them.
  - Tighten hallucination guard: explicitly ask the model to refuse outside-sources claims.
  - Make citation format stricter (require page/section and quote snippets for thresholds).
  - Add explicit preference order: WADA docs for global rules; WFDF docs for sport-specific process.
  - Add “in-competition” window definition reminder and supplement-risk guidance.
  - Add answer structure labels to keep outputs consistent.

Preference and scope
- Prefer WADA global documents (Prohibited List, Code, IS) for substance/method status and universal rules.
- Use WFDF documents for WFDF‑specific processes (e.g., TUE submission to WFDF, WFDF privacy, WFDF sanctions presentation).
- When content overlaps, cite both and note which is controlling for the question.
- For substances/methods, check the Prohibited List 2025 first (S0–S9, M1–M3), then confirm any sport‑specific notes in WFDF docs.

Citations
- Always include citations:
  - PDFs: “Document title (filename), p. X” and section numbers/letters if present.
  - Markdown: “Filename, [Section Heading]”.
- For thresholds/limits (e.g., beta‑2 agonists, pseudoephedrine, glucocorticoids, IV volumes), quote the relevant line or phrase.

Policy nuances
- Always clarify: in‑competition vs out‑of‑competition applicability, thresholds, and route of administration.
- In‑competition window: begins at 11:59 p.m. on the day before a competition unless the List defines otherwise; cite the List if it specifies a different window.
- Supplements: not regulated like medicines and may be contaminated; advise caution and refer to S0 and Athlete Guide notes where relevant.
- If a substance is not listed, say it is not listed and indicate the closest applicable class/category to review.

Safety and disclaimers
- Educational information only; not medical or legal advice.
- Policies change; prefer the latest documents and state effective years (e.g., “2025 Prohibited List”).
- If the needed document year is missing, state which year you’re using and suggest verifying the latest version.
- Decline medical dosing or personalized advice; you may still cite policy constraints.

Answer format
- Answer: 1–3 sentences, directly addressing the question.
- Why/Where: citations (document + page/section), and quote key thresholds if applicable.
- If helpful: brief checklist or steps.

Examples
- Q: “Is creatine prohibited?”
  - Answer: “Creatine is not listed as a prohibited substance on the WADA Prohibited List 2025; it is generally permitted. Verify the current year’s List before competition.”
  - Why/Where: “WADA Prohibited List 2025 (2025list_en_final_clean_12_september_2024.pdf): no entry under S0–S9; Athlete Guide to the 2025 List, supplements section.”

- Q: “Can I use inhaled salbutamol?”
  - Answer: “Inhaled salbutamol is permitted within specified dose limits and subject to a urinary threshold; exceeding limits or using other routes can be prohibited. A TUE may be required above limits.”
  - Why/Where: “WADA Prohibited List 2025, S3 Beta‑2 Agonists (2025list_en_final_clean_12_september_2024.pdf), p. [exact page]; ISTUE 2023 (international_standard_for_therapeutic_use_exemptions_istue_2023.pdf).”

- Q: “Are IV infusions allowed for recovery?”
  - Answer: “IV infusions/injections >100 mL per 12 hours are prohibited except during legitimate hospital/clinical procedures or with a TUE.”
  - Why/Where: “WADA Prohibited List 2025, M2 (2025list_en_final_clean_12_september_2024.pdf), p. [exact page]; ISTI 2023 (isti_2023_w_annex_k_final_clean.pdf).”

- Q: “What happens if I miss a test?”
  - Answer: “A missed test or filing failure can count as a Whereabouts failure; three within 12 months may constitute an ADRV.”
  - Why/Where: “ISTI 2023 (isti_2023_w_annex_k_final_clean.pdf); WADA Code 2021 (2021_wada_code.pdf); WFDF ADRV overview (03-anti-doping-rule-violations-(adrv's).md).”

When uncertain
- If the precise threshold/limit/page isn’t found, say “I’m not fully certain,” provide best‑matching sections to check, and offer to quote the relevant passages.
- If asked for medical dosing/personalized advice, decline and refer to a healthcare professional, while citing relevant policy constraints.

Style
- Be concise, accurate, and neutral. Use the documents’ terminology (S‑classes; ISTI/ISTUE references).
- Keep answers scannable with short paragraphs or brief bullets.
```

- Two small tasks before you test
  - Upload the two WFDF PDFs from `misc/` so the assistant can cite them.
  - Remove or keep browsing disabled to avoid conflicting behavior with “no web sources.”

- Want me to draft the conversation starters and a 10‑item smoke test set next?

_**User (2025-09-29 18:49Z)**_

I actually do want the GPT to use web or external sources; I just want it to be very clear when it's done that in one of its answers. It's important that it references those sources, but it should really only use web or external sources when information is unclear, conflicting, or out of the document scope. With that in mind, can you update the custom GPT instructions?

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating instructions for web use**

I'm thinking about updating the instructions in customGPT.md to allow for conditional web use. I'll need to follow the workflow for status and todo updates before I edit anything. It seems the task of updating system instructions is already in progress, and the current file removed the earlier "Do not use web" section. So, I’ll need to edit customGPT.md to reflect the new conditional web use, and it makes sense to read the full file to understand the context before applying any modifications.
**Adding web usage policy**

I need to include a section in the instructions about web usage policy and the citation format for external sources. Since I can’t configure this in the UI, I’ll focus on just the instructions themselves. I’ll make sure not to be overly verbose while following the correct formatting. After I edit the document, I'll update the todo_write to keep track of it being in progress, and then provide a brief summary. First step, I should read the file.</details></think>

---

I’m going to update `customGPT.md` to allow conditional web/external sources with strict citation rules, and adjust the instructions accordingly.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating system instructions**

I need to update the file customGPT.md to change the prohibition on web sources to allow for conditional use, ensuring there's clear marking and citations. The instructions also need an update. I should use the edit tool to apply a patch. However, the user prefers to review diffs before any edits are made, so I should propose the diff in a message and ask for their approval rather than applying it immediately.
**Preparing updates for approval**

The developer instructions state not to stop for approval unless something is blocked, but my memory indicates the user's preference for that process. I need to cite memory while following their wishes. So, I’ll propose a minimal diff to replace line 10 and add a new section about the external sources policy. Specifically, I’ll change line 10 to clarify when web sources may be used and insert this new policy right after that.
**Drafting external sources policy**

When using external sources, I need to ensure I explicitly state their use, provide clickable URLs with titles, and prioritize official WFDF or WADA domains and other authoritative bodies. I can't override uploaded documents unless they're older than newer official sources; any conflict needs to be surfaced along with the note of recency. I'll update this section and perhaps add an "External Sources Policy" after line 10. Since the user prefers reviewing the diff first, I’ll present the content in a markdown code block instead of running apply_patch.
**Preparing diff for review**

My memory indicates that the user wants to review the exact changes in code, specifically the diffs. I'll show a diff using apply_patch style or a standard unified diff. Since we aren't applying the changes now, I can present the diff in a message instead. Following the citing_code specification, I’ll use the markdown code block with the language tag for the new proposed code. I plan to change line 10 and add a new section starting at line 11, but I should keep in mind that line numbers might shift.
**Creating minimal diff for review**

I'll prepare a minimal diff that includes a replacement for line 10 and adds a new section called "External sources (conditional, fully cited)." In this section, I'll specify to use external sources only when the uploaded content is unclear or conflicting. I'll also instruct the user to start sentences with "External source used:" while listing sources with titles and URLs, preferring official sites. Additionally, I'll update line 8 from "Answer strictly from uploaded" to "Answer primarily from uploaded." I’ll present this exact diff and ask for permission to apply the edits.</details></think>

I’m proposing an update to `customGPT.md` to allow conditional web/external sources with strict disclosure and citation. I’ll apply it after you approve the diff, per your preference to review edits first [[memory:3260797]].

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating documentation**

I'm looking to edit customGPT.md by adding sections for Conversation Starters and Smoke Tests. First, I need to update the todo list to mark the starters evaluation as in progress, and then maybe mark it as completed after the edits. I'll use apply_patch to append the new sections while keeping the indentation consistent with spaces, as the file follows standard Markdown. I should create content for starters that tests external source behavior and include a smoke tests list with 10 items, with behavior and citation placeholders. Finally, I'll provide a brief summary after the updates.
**Creating content for starters**

I'm crafting sections for Conversation Starters, including questions like whether creatine is prohibited, and what substances are banned in and out of competition. I also want to include how to apply for a TUE with WFDF, the dose limits for inhaled salbutamol, and the rules around IV infusions for recovery. Additionally, I'll check if glucocorticoids are permitted in competition, the caffeine status and thresholds—which might need an external source—and details about pseudoephedrine, specifically the threshold of 150 micrograms/mL.
**Structuring obligations and tests**

I want to avoid hardcoding and keep details like "quote thresholds with citation" flexible. I need to cover obligations such as whereabouts for RTP/TP, what happens if someone misses a test, and how the in-competition window is defined. Additionally, I’ll explore how WFDF manages personal data, aiming for around 10-12 entries.

For smoke tests, I need to outline steps, like stating that creatine isn't listed, salbutamol is permitted within limits, and mentioning the threshold for pseudoephedrine. I'll also include information on glucocorticoids, IV infusions, and needle policies, possibly needing external sources.
**Clarifying references and process**

I think it’s important to present information from ISTI and ensure I include citations. For the in-competition window definition, I’ll reference the list header or Code/ISTI, and if it’s unclear, I might check WADA FAQ for an external source, making sure to note that an external source was used.

For the TUE process with WFDF, I'll cite the WFDF TUE PDF and ISTUE, avoiding external sources. For whereabouts, I should reference ISTI Annex I or K generically.

When discussing privacy, I’ll cite the WFDF privacy notice and ISPPPI. Additionally, I should include a test for external source behavior, like asking, "What changed between the 2024 and 2025 List for X?" I’ll make sure to format everything consistently.</details></think>

Perfect! I've updated `customGPT.md` with your feedback:

### Key changes made:

1. **Confidence assessments**: Added a required confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to all responses based on:
   - High: Clear answer from uploaded documents
   - Medium: Some ambiguity or interpretation needed
   - Low: Heavy reliance on external sources or uncertainty

2. **More permissive external sourcing**: Updated the external sources section to:
   - Allow external sources for practical guidance questions (like marijuana cessation timing)
   - Include medical/scientific sources for guidance
   - Explicitly handle guidance questions with best-practice recommendations

3. **Enhanced examples**: Added a marijuana cessation example showing:
   - Policy citation (S8 Cannabinoids, in-competition only)
   - External scientific sources for detection windows
   - Medium confidence level
   - Conservative recommendation (2-4 weeks)

4. **Updated conversation starters**: Added marijuana and supplement timing questions

5. **New smoke test**: Added test #12 for guidance questions to validate external source usage

The GPT will now be more helpful for practical questions while maintaining strict citation requirements and transparency about confidence levels.

Update @customGPT.md with the following feedback in mind:
- When answering a question for a quiz with multiple choice or options, optimize your response for the person filling out the quiz. For example, your response should include the options in the exact same order in which they're shared, making it easier to scan and respond to the quiz.

Perfect! I've updated `customGPT.md` to optimize responses for quiz questions:

### Key changes made:

1. **Answer format section**: Added specific guidance for quiz questions:
   - Present options in the exact same order provided
   - Make it easy to scan and select the correct answer
   - Clearly indicate which option(s) are correct and why

2. **New example**: Added a multiple-choice Whereabouts question example showing:
   - Options presented in exact order (A, B, C, D)
   - Each option marked with ✓ or (CORRECT)
   - Clear explanation of why each element is required
   - High confidence with proper citations

3. **New smoke test**: Added test #13 for multiple-choice quiz questions to validate:
   - Options presented in exact order
   - Clear marking of correct/incorrect answers
   - Explanation for each option
   - Proper citations

Now when someone asks a quiz question like "Which of the following must be included in Whereabouts information? A) Home address, B) Email contact, C) Daily 60-minute time slot, D) All of the above", the GPT will respond with:

- **Answer**: "D) All of the above - All three elements are required..."
- **Options in order**: A) Home address ✓, B) Email contact ✓, C) Daily 60-minute time slot ✓, D) All of the above ✓ (CORRECT)
- **Why/Where**: Proper citations
- **Confidence**: High

This makes it much easier for quiz-takers to quickly scan and select the right answer!

Perfect! I've updated `customGPT.md` to emphasize using the exact same words/phrasing as quiz questions:

### Key changes made:

1. **Answer format section**: Enhanced the quiz guidance to specify:
   - Use the exact same words/phrasing as the quiz
   - Use the exact same prefix and suffix 
   - Make it really easy for users to compare suggestions with quiz options

2. **Smoke test #13**: Updated the expected behavior to emphasize:
   - Present options in exact order using exact same words/phrasing
   - This ensures the GPT maintains perfect word-for-word matching

Now when someone asks a quiz question like "Which substances are prohibited in-competition? A) Creatine, B) Caffeine, C) Cannabis, D) All of the above", the GPT will respond with:

- **Answer**: "C) Cannabis - Cannabis is prohibited in-competition only."
- **Options in order**: A) Creatine ✗, B) Caffeine ✗, C) Cannabis ✓ (CORRECT), D) All of the above ✗
- **Why/Where**: Proper citations
- **Confidence**: High

The key improvement is that it will use the exact same words "A) Creatine", "B) Caffeine", "C) Cannabis", "D) All of the above" making it super easy for quiz-takers to match exactly what they see in the quiz interface!

_**User (2025-09-29 18:49Z)**_

Can you make me a logo for this WFDF Anti-Doping Assistant GPT? Attached is the WFDF logo, so you could riff off that if you want.

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

Creating a logo for the WFDF Anti-Doping Assistant that builds on the WFDF logo, incorporating anti-doping elements.


---

Tool create_diagram not found.

---

I can’t generate images here. Here’s a concise spec you can hand off to a designer or implement in a tool like Canva, Figma, or Adobe Illustrator.

## Logo Design Concept: WFDF Anti-Doping Assistant

### Design elements
- Base: WFDF logo (black "WFDF" with blue/red curved bars)
- Add: Shield icon (anti-doping symbol)
- Add: Chat bubble or assistant indicator
- Colors: Keep WFDF palette (black, blue, red, white)

### Layout options

**Option 1: Shield integration**
```
[WFDF Logo]
    [Shield Icon]
"ANTI-DOPING ASSISTANT"
```

**Option 2: Side-by-side**
```
[WFDF Logo] + [Shield + Chat Bubble]
"WFDF ANTI-DOPING ASSISTANT"
```

**Option 3: Overlay**
```
[WFDF Logo with small shield in corner]
"ANTI-DOPING ASSISTANT"
```

### Implementation steps
1. Use the existing WFDF logo as the base
2. Add a shield icon (blue or red)
3. Optionally add a small chat bubble
4. Add "ANTI-DOPING ASSISTANT" below in a clean sans-serif
5. Keep the overall look professional and consistent with WFDF branding

### Tools
- Canva: search “shield logo” templates
- Figma: import the WFDF logo and add elements
- Adobe Illustrator: vector-based design
- LogoMaker: AI logo generator

Should I draft a detailed spec for a designer, or do you want to try one of these tools?

_**User (2025-09-29 18:49Z)**_

Can you make me option 1 here?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I can’t generate images here. Here’s a step-by-step guide to create Option 1 (Shield Integration) in Canva:

## Step-by-Step: Create Option 1 Logo in Canva

### 1. Set up
- Go to canva.com and sign in
- Create a new design → Custom size → 800x600px (or 1:1 square)

### 2. Add the WFDF logo
- Upload the WFDF logo image
- Place it at the top center
- Resize to ~60% of the canvas height

### 3. Add the shield icon
- Search “shield” in Elements
- Choose a simple shield (blue or red)
- Place it centered below the WFDF logo
- Resize to ~20% of the canvas height

### 4. Add the text
- Add a text box below the shield
- Type: "ANTI-DOPING ASSISTANT"
- Font: Arial Bold or similar sans-serif
- Size: ~24–28px
- Color: Black
- Center align

### 5. Finalize
- Adjust spacing between elements
- Ensure the shield color matches WFDF (blue or red)
- Export as PNG with a transparent background

### Alternative: Quick text-based version
If you want a text-only version for now, I can create an ASCII art version that you could use as a placeholder:

```
    WFDF
   ═══════
     🛡️
ANTI-DOPING ASSISTANT
```

Should I create the ASCII version, or do you want to try the Canva approach?

I'm getting this error when uploading the latest customgpt instructions. Can you help me fix this?

GPT instructions cannot be longer than 8000 characters. If you need to provide more context, you may want to attach a file or knowledge document.

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

The instructions exceed the 8,000-character limit. Condensing them to fit while preserving core functionality.

Created a condensed version that fits the 8,000-character limit.

## Condensed Instructions (2,754 characters)

Saved as `customGPT_condensed.md`. It includes:

### What I kept:
- Core behavior and external source rules
- Answer format with confidence levels
- Quiz optimization (exact words/phrasing)
- Policy guidance essentials
- Safety disclaimers
- Key examples (creatine, marijuana, quiz format)
- Uncertainty handling

### What I removed:
- Detailed file lists (handled by uploads)
- Extensive smoke tests (use for validation)
- Conversation starters (add in GPT builder)
- Verbose explanations
- Redundant policy details

### Next steps:
1. Copy the content from `customGPT_condensed.md`
2. Paste it into the GPT builder’s Instructions field
3. Upload your knowledge files
4. Add conversation starters in the GPT builder
5. Run smoke tests manually

This version is 2,754 characters, well under the 8,000 limit, and preserves the essential functionality.

---

_**User (2025-09-29 18:49Z)**_

ok can you try again? keep your changes isolated to the @customGPT_instructions.md file. No need to condense things too much beyond 8k character limit. retain as much of the spirit of the original as possible.
